// crates/mira-server/src/background/code_health/detection.rs
// Detection module -- retained as a minimal stub.
// All heuristic detectors (TODO, unwrap, unimplemented, error handling) have been
// removed. Only cargo check warnings and unused function detection (call-graph-based)
// remain in the code health system, handled by cargo.rs and mod.rs respectively.
