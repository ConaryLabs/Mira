## When to Use vs. When to Avoid

**Use bulk_review_findings when:**
- You have 5+ findings needing identical status
- Findings are from the same expert/type (e.g., "all security suggestions")
- No individual feedback needed
- Quick cleanup of minor/style issues

**Use review_finding instead when:**
- You need to provide specific feedback
- The finding requires careful consideration
- You want to contribute to pattern learning
- The finding might set a precedent
