## MCP Tools

Beyond slash commands, Mira provides 9 MCP tools that Claude uses automatically:

`memory`, `code`, `diff`, `project`, `session`, `insights`, `goal`, `index`, `recipe`

These power semantic search, call graph analysis, persistent memory, and more — no slash command needed.

## Tip

Run `/mira:status` to check that Mira is healthy and see your active goals.
